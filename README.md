# what.CD Artwork Downloader

Py3K only

##What it does?
It goes trough every subfolder of a given directory, checks if this directory contains Audio-Files (currently only FLAC and MP3, had some trouble with AAC) and has already a folder.jpg - if not, it looks one up in iTunes according to the tags of the files and if there's one it saves it into the folder. If the script can't find iTunes Artwork, it will try to search what.cd for Artwork.
